                        My name is <strong>Rishabh Salt</strong>. I am a dedicated and motivated student 
                        with a strong interest in technology, coding, and problem-solving. I enjoy learning 
                        new concepts and applying them to build real-world projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, C programming, and I am continuously 
                        exploring new tools and technologies. I believe in consistent practice and hands-on 
                        learning to improve my skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from academics, I like collaborating with my classmates, participating in 
                        technical events, and contributing to group projects. My goal is to become a 
                        proficient developer and work on impactful applications in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This portfolio is a small step towards showcasing my journey, skills, and the 
                        projects I have worked on so far.
